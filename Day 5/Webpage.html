                        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">The song was debuted on
                            Annie Mac's BBC radio show on 30 November 2015. According to Berryman, lead singer Chris
                            Martin originally wanted the song to be a party song with the lyrics "drinks on me, drinks
                            on me", but his bandmates didn't think that would go well with their fans. Martin's longtime
                            friend Beyoncé was asked to sing on the song, and she accepted the request.<br><br>

                            Martin corroborated Berryman's story about the band protesting him singing, "Drinks on me,
                            drinks on me" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. According to Martin, the
                            original kernel was that he "was listening to Flo Rida or something", and he thought, "it's
                            such a shame that Coldplay could never have one of those late-night club songs, like "Turn
                            Down for What". I thought I'd like to have a song called 'Drinks on Me' where you sit on the
                            side of a club and buy everyone drinks because you're so fucking cool," Martin recalled. "I
                            was chuckling about that, when this melody came, 'drinks on me, drinks on me', then the rest
                            of the song came out. I presented it to the rest of the band and they said, 'We love this
                            song, but there's no way you can sing "drinks on me."' So that changed into 'drink from me'
                            and the idea of having an angelic person in your life."</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">Furlong noted that he
                            began writing the song as an ode to his father. The inspiration for the “pirate-y fight
                            song” sound came to him while at a bar in Ireland. Furlong sent the original idea, titled
                            "My Father Told Me", to Arash Pournouri, Avicii's manager. Pournouri recognised an immediate
                            draw to the track, saying that the song had that same sense of euphoria which characterises
                            so much of Avicii's music. In an interview with Yahoo! Music, Pournouri said: "It made
                            absolute sense to work on it with Nick...[Avicii and I just needed] to make it more 'us' and
                            that's what [we] did.<br><br>
                            Like his previous hits "Wake Me Up" and "Hey Brother", "The Nights" is a progressive house
                            song containing elements of folk rock.</p>

                            Perfect", which features a verse from American rapper Pusha.<br><br>
                            In July 2022, the song was issued to contemporary hit radio in the United States as an
                            official single, after gaining success from usage as backing music on TikTok and in
                            commercials. The song has accumulated prolonged success as a sleeper hit, garnering
                            increasing attention over the course of six years, and reappeared on worldwide charts in the
                            early 2020s.</p>

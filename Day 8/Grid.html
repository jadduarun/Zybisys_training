          I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined, I honestly feel I
          got every penny's worth.

          looking to make a transition and have heared some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I've successfully switches careeres, working as a Software
          Engineer at a VR startup."

          "Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, In particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
          often an referred to It during interviews as an example of my
          development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
          full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.

          able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
          developer. The standard is about the rest. You will get the personal
          attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
